# Project

A Summer Internship Task to perform.

Basically,first I had to fetch the fields from config.ini files and using that I iinitialised the timer interval as well as other fields.
The task was to synchronise the information of other servers with the training servers in order to use it for other tasks , such as data backup and performance and trend analysis.

The code is commmented as well as a user manual is also provided with other necessary information.
